            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">About Us</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Nava Raipur Atal Nagar Vikas Pradhikaran (NRANVP), envisioned as the capital of Chhattisgarh after it attained statehood on 1st November 2000, is located 24 km from Raipur. As a satellite city, it offers a blank slate for planned urban development, including sustainable and inclusive urban transport systems.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Urban transport demand emerged with the relocation of the State Secretariat and Government offices in 2013. Residential development in four key sectors followed, with the population gradually increasing. Current transport demand is characterized by commuting patterns between Raipur, Nava Raipur Atal Nagar, and nearby towns, especially during peak AM and PM hours. A more uniform intra-city transport demand is expected as the city matures with operational social, commercial, and healthcare facilities, and more residents settle in.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">BRT Lite Nava Raipur Atal Nagar named “Tatpar” was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 1st November 2016. The BRT infrastructure are unique in design and quality of construction is high. The BRT buses are BS-IV compliant, fully AC, and Ultra-Modern in look and performance with automatic transmission. They are also IT-equipped with features like CCTV surveillance for enhanced safety and route information displays for a seamless travel experience. The Buses operate at every 15 minute frequency at peak hours and at every 30 minute frequency at peak hours from 6.00 AM to 10.00 PM. The fleet size comprises of 30 nos. USB-II compliant AC BRT Buses which ply in mixed traffic in Raipur and in soft marked corridor in Nava Raipur Atal Nagar. The Buses have RFID assisted docking facilities in the median shelters and also have facilities for kerb side boarding. The Buses and Shelters have CCTV Surveillance System. The buses and the shelters allow barrier free movement of wheel chairs. Fare Matrix is competitive with that of Non AC Buses so as to keep it affordable and accessible to all section of riders. The operation is successful with Zero Accident System. The design and construction of cycle track and pedestrian pathway and crossings are made such that especially abled persons can easily use them. The project has a vital role to implement Nava Raipur Atal Nagar vision of ‘Mobility of all, affordable, equitable and safe’.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The BRTS Lite System ensures seamless multi-modal connectivity across the city. The BRT routes are strategically planned to connect major transit hubs, including Raipur Railway Station at Raipur, CBD Railway Station at Nava Raipur Atal Nagar, and inter-state bus stops along NH-30 and NH-53. Additionally, the system enhances last-mile connectivity to residential and commercial sectors through e-Autos and a Public Bicycle Sharing (PBS) network, promoting efficient and sustainable urban mobility.</p>
